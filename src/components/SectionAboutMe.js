    <p>Hi, I'm Mar√≠a Luisa, junior frontend developer. I really like technology and gaming and that is why in the last years of my life I have decided to study it to become a web developer.
    In high school it was the first time I had contacts with technology and i started studying HTML and CSS.
    The world of technology is full of possibilities and challenges and I'm looking forward to getting started.
    Professionally, I really like working in team to help and solve problems.
